					<br><br>Project Description<br>
					For the 30 minute Film Project, our team decided to shoot each of our own quarantine lives and compiling them together into a video. Each scene of the video compose a variety of how people spend time during quarantine. The upbeat, positive feeling this video gives provides a more open-minded view towards quarantine, focusing on our potentials by spending more time with ourselves. The overall website, however, aims to provide a nature related theme, which represents the environmentalist, nature-loving side of me.
					<br><br>
					Our team implemented this concept by just taking a short videos of our lives on our own to show the randomness of our quarantine lives. We did not specify any particular perspective or action because we are hoping for a portrayal as diverse as they can be, which is why there are first-person perspectives and third-person perspectives. After we all take snippets of our lives, I edited them into a cohesive video of "What People Do". To match with the randomness theme as presented in the film, I included an interactive feature of the webpage - alternating words showing up under "What People Do." This is to give an idea of the different actions or key words significant during this time.
					As this project is part of the "vids" section of my website, the background has a low opacity image of me holding the camera filming. This background is meant to fit the theme of the video category. The low opacity image theme will be constant across my website, with a different photo of me in different categories, matched with an image related to nature on top of it.
					<br><br>
					For the short film, I took this as more of an experience to learn from instead of my best project. After watching other examples, I thought we could've planned the shooting better to including snippets with a variety of length. There could've also been just one videographer for a more unified theme. However, these weaknesses of our film can also be our strength, including the variety of perspectives and actions shot in the snippets that composed the film. For future projects, I would take more time to consider and plan what would be the most efficient portrayal of our intentions in order to produce a well-edited video in the given time constraints.
					For the website, I am mostly satisfied with the look or design of the outcome. However, I would spend more time to improve the website by making it viewable across different webpage sizes, perhaps less relying on absolute positioning. I know this will not be the end product as I will continue to refine the webpage. Overall, the outcome depicts my webpage's initial concept and my expectations were met, except for refining the code of the webpage.
